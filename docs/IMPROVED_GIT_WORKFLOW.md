# Improved GitHub Workflow

## Enhanced Branch Strategy

### Branches
- **`main`**: Production branch (protected)
- **`develop`**: Development branch
- **`feature/*`**: Feature branches (optional)
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency fixes

### Workflow Options

#### Option 1: Simple (Current)
```
develop → testing → main
```

#### Option 2: Enhanced with Feature Branches
```
feature/new-feature → develop → testing → main
```

#### Option 3: GitHub Flow with Pull Requests
```
feature/new-feature → Pull Request → develop → Pull Request → main
```

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
```bash
# Create GitHub repository and add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/AINO-develop.git
git push -u origin main
git push -u origin develop
```

### 2. Branch Protection Rules
- Protect `main` branch from direct pushes
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date

### 3. Automated Testing
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Run tests on every push to `develop`
- Run tests before merging to `main`

### 4. Pull Request Workflow
- Create pull requests for all changes
- Require at least one review
- Use descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Link issues to PRs

### 5. Emergency Procedures
- Hotfix branches for urgent fixes
- Rollback procedures
- Incident response plan

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Add remote origin
3. Push initial branches
4. Set up branch protection

### Phase 2: Automation
1. Set up GitHub Actions
2. Configure automated testing
3. Set up deployment pipeline

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement feature branch workflow
2. Add code quality checks
3. Set up monitoring and alerts

## Commands for Setup

```bash
# Initial setup
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/AINO-develop.git
git push -u origin main
git push -u origin develop

# Daily workflow
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin develop

# Merge to main (when instructed)
